after watching result of ploting, i think user_id and product_id have relation. which user_id who shop often and product in demand is related, so user frequent to buy same product/ buy product which have product_id around the range.
so the business recomendation for me is increasing product on demand (product have product id <100) and evaluating less preferred product. other than that, advertise product/recomendating to user especially user didnt have high frequency to try best-selling product maybe can make them interest to buy that product. evaluating less preferred product can through comparing criteria from preferred product and not, and extracted data finding using statistic.
