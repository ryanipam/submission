Im sorry if i cant perform the program using python, because yesterday im trying to make document classification using python i got obstacle and stuck, it is my first time try to make document classification (both in python or in weka). i spend to much time trying to learn and use python for document classification. but at the end because of my stuck code im try to use weka because im very familiar before. After this i will try to learning further to solve this using python.

in weka im using weka 3.8.2, and im load the csv file which after im clean for fit support data weka, and then im convert to arff for declaring review as string text. next im using preprocess weka filter stringtowordsvector to split the review. then im using classify using SVM algorithm (in weka SMO) because i try another algorithm like naive bayes and decission tree the SVM have greatest accuracy. Naive bayes got 54% accuracy, dectree got 58% accuracy, and the svm i got 77%. i include the screenshot and already create the model.

after i got model, i got another obstacle for re evaluate model in test file, because the weka doesnt assume the review as string. im already convert to string by declaring arff file, but while im import weka still assume it error. i make sure the process is same with first time i make model and trying the document classifier in train data. but i still wonder why it doesnt work.
im sory if this cant solved, but further i will try to use the right tools like python for document classifying and for my learning after this.
